"Much can be
said about the pattern of sound reflections during
the first 100 msec or so of the reverberant response,
however. It is convenient as well as perceptually
meaningful to simulate these reflections directly by
considering the configuration of the room to be
modeled." - CZAS PIERWSZYCH ODBIĆ
"Much research has been done to determine the importance of the early response, which occurs
roughly during the first 50-100 msec of the reverberation impulse response"
"Measurements and simulations of the early reflections in concert halls
have demonstrated that time separation, frequency characteristics, and incident angle of the reflections
are important perceptual cues of reverberation (Jordan 1969; Barron 1971; 1974)"
"The length of
each delay determines the amount of the early response that can be simulated for that channel and
direction."
"Actual delays, amplitudes, and incident directions of the early reflections may be chosen by
defining a room of particular dimensions and employing the method of image sources to determine
the reflections from the walls (Moorer 1979). An
enhancement of this method is to define objects in
the room and consider reflections from them as
well." - i napisać, że w moim przypadku nie chcę odwzorować konkretnego pomieszczenia,

"The amplitude of the sound
pressure emanating from a simple source (point
source) drops as I/distance when the distance is
greater than a few wavelengths or so" - SPADEK AMPLITUDY
" Near field
effects of actual sound radiators are generally very
complicated, so when the distance from the source
is less than a few wavelengths we can approximate
the amplitude of the sound pressure as being virtually unchanged. "
